  ## This project is uses the OpenWeather API to allow the user to see the five day forecast of the weather in their desired selected city, as well as the current tempurature at the time of their search.

  - My motivation for this project was to try and learn more about using APIs and learning how to develop server side and how that communicates with the client side. While this project had been very difficult, it has taught me to try and keep learning the concepts.
  - I built this project so that I may have a way to search for a desired city, for instance San Juan Capistrano, and see the current weather conditions for that very day, plus see an additional five day forecast of the following five days. This information was gathered using the OpenWeather API and not information I am able to hard code myself.
  - This project solves the problem of being able to see the current week's forcast in a location of my choosing. Furthermore, this project solves the problem of individuals who may want to see weather conditions in a location they have never seen or been and may not know the proper spelling, as it is hard coded to understand these mistakes and understand what it is the user is searching for.
  - This assignment has brought me the opportunity to learn a lot of new information through much repitiion in learning. I spent many hours in office hours this week, as well as my tutoring sessions, trying to fully grasp the concept of server-side coding and incorperating APIs, and even beginning to understand what an API is and their purposes. I think of APIs as pieces to a puzzle, where the puzzle itself is an app. The puzzle would not be a puzzle without the pieces it is made up of, nor an app without the APIs incorperated. Furthermore, a puzzle can only work if the individual pieces are properly able to communicate with one another, much like APIs have to coordinate with the front and back ends of a webpage to work properly. When coding server/client side, there are multiple different files that can be overwhelming, and while both are TECHNICALLY able to operate independent of one another, either will having missing features/capabilities without the other.
